WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <FLAG_IN> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <CRST> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization

WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 15-bit latch for signal <CRST>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
